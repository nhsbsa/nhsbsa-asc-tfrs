                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>you’ll need to sign a declaration to confirm claims made by your organisation will be accurate and non-fraudulent</li>
                    <li>to limit the amount of new information you’ll need to enter, some information in your account has come from the Adult Social Care Workforce Dataset (ASC-WDS)</li>
                    <li>for additional security, sign in will require two-factor authentication (2FA) using Microsoft Authenticator (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app">get help with this)</a></li>
                    <li>you’ll need to have your organisation bank account details to hand</li>
                </ul>
