                    The <strong>Claim for adult social care learning and development</strong> service allows you to claim reimbursement for part of the costs of learning and development for staff working in adult social care.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    This guidance will help you with starting a new claim quickly and easily. We particularly recommend making sure you understand the evidence requirements as submitting incomplete evidence is the main reason for claims to be rejected.
                </p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Claims</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    A claim is made up of:
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>the name of the training course or qualification</li>
                    <li>the date it took place or started</li>
                    <li>the learner who did the training</li>
                    <li>the evidence that you paid for the training and that the learners completed it</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    A claim cannot consist of more than one training activity or learner.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    So if one learner completed several courses you would need to submit a separate claim for each one. Similarly, if several learners completed the same course, you would need to claim separately for each.
                </p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reimbursement amounts</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Every course or qualification has a maximum reimbursement amount. This is the most you could get back and may be less than the training actually cost.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If you paid less than the maximum reimbursement amount, you’ll get back what you paid. You can find the maximum reimbursement amounts in the scheme guidance.
                </p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Completing a claim</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    To start a new claim, click on the ‘Start a new claim’ button in the top right of the ‘Manage
                    claims’ screen.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Course or qualification</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You’ll first need to select the course or qualification that you’re claiming for. You can search by name, course code or qualification number. If you search by just part of the name you might get lots of results. Click ‘Select’ to pick the right one.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Claims for courses are known as ‘100 claims’ as you’ll get 100% of the reimbursement amount in a single payment after course completion.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If you select an eligible qualification, you’ll be asked to choose whether you want a split payment. If you select the 60/40 funding model, you’ll be able to submit a combined 60/40 claim. This means you’ll get 60% of the reimbursement amount when you submit the 60 part of the claim. You’ll get the remaining 40% on training completion when you submit the related 40 part. 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You may choose not to use this, however, in which case you’ll get 100% of the reimbursement amount on training completion.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    You’ll now be taken to the claim screen where you can complete the remaining information for the claim.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Start date</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    This is the date that the training took place or began.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Learner</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Click ‘Add learner’ and search by name or National Insurance number to see if they’re already on the system. If they are,
                    just click ‘Add to claim’. Otherwise click ‘Add new learner’, enter their name, National Insurance number and job title. Then click ‘Save and add to claim’.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Evidence of payment</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The payment date is the date you paid the training provider.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    There’s separate guidance to explain the evidence you’ll need to upload. To provide all the necessary information you may need to upload both an invoice and receipt. You can upload up to 4 files in total.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If you do not have a document in digital form, you’ll need to scan, photograph or screenshot it.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Evidence of completion</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If you’re submitting a 60/40 claim, evidence of completion is not required for the 60 part, as these are submitted prior to the training being completed. 
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    Enter the date that the learner completed the training.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The evidence of this should be their certificate from the training provider.
                </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Saving or submitting</h3>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If there's still information to add another time, press 'Save and finish later'. The claim will be saved to the 'Not yet submitted' list on the 'Manage claims' screen.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    If you've finished adding everything to the claim you can press 'Confirm details' and then ‘Submit claim’ to confirm you’ve understood the declaration. This will send the claim for processing. The claim will move to the 'Submitted' status on the 'Manage claims' screen and you will no longer be able to edit it.
                </p>
                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The aim is to process your claim as quickly as possible, in accordance with scheme guidance.
