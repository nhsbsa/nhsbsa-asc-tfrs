            The <strong>Claim for adult social care learning and development</strong> service allows you to claim reimbursement for part of the costs of learning and development for staff working in adult social care.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            This guidance will help you with starting a new claim quickly and easily. We particularly recommend making sure you understand <a href="tu-evidence-requirements.html">what evidence you need to provide</a> as submitting incomplete evidence is the main reason for claims to be rejected.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What’s included in a claim</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            A claim is made up of:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>the training course or qualification</li>
            <li>the dates it:
                <ul>
                    <li>took place or started</li>
                    <li>was paid for</li>
                    <li>was completed</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>the learner who did the training</li>
            <li>evidence that you paid for the training and that the learner completed it</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Each claim consists of one training activity for one learner.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If one learner completes several courses you will need to submit a separate claim for each course. Similarly, if several learners complete the same course, you will need to claim separately for each learner.        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Reimbursement amounts explained</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Every course or qualification has a maximum reimbursement amount. This is the most you could get back and may be less than the training actually cost.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you paid less than the maximum reimbursement amount, you’ll get back what you paid. You can find the maximum reimbursement amounts in the list of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-learning-and-development-support-scheme/eligible-training-courses-and-qualifications" target="_blank">eligible training courses and qualifications (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">This does not apply to in-house Oliver McGowan Mandatory Training (OMMT), which has a fixed reimbursement amount.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Completing a claim</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
           To start a new claim, click on the green ‘Start a new claim’ button in the top right corner of the ‘Manage claims’ screen.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Training</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            You’ll first need to select the course or qualification that you’re claiming for. You can search by:
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>name</li>
                <li>course code</li>
                <li>qualification number</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Some courses are offered by a range of awarding organisations. If you search by just part of the name you might get lots of similar results. Make sure you have the correct one before you click 'Select’.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Claims for courses are known as ‘100 claims’ as you’ll get 100% of the reimbursement amount in a single payment after course completion.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you select an eligible qualification, you’ll be asked to choose whether you want a split payment. If you select the 60/40 funding model, you’ll be able to submit a combined 60/40 claim. This means you’ll get 60% of the reimbursement amount when you submit the 60 part of the claim. You’ll get the remaining 40% when you submit the 40 part of the claim on course completion.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you choose not to use the 60/40 model, you’ll get 100% of the reimbursement amount on course completion.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Once you’ve completed this section, you can complete the remaining information for the claim, including:
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Start date</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            This is the date that the training took place or began.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Payment date</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">

        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            There’s separate guidance on <a href="tu-evidence-requirements.html">what evidence you need to provide</a>. To provide all the necessary information you may need to upload both an invoice and receipt. You can upload up to 4 files in total.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you do not have a document in digital form, you’ll need to scan, photograph or screenshot it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Learner</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Click ‘Add learner’ and search by name or National Insurance number to see if they’re already on the system. If they are, just click ‘Add to claim’. Otherwise click ‘Add new learner’, enter their name, National Insurance number and job title. Then click ‘Save and add to claim’.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Completion date</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            This is the date the learner completed the training.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Evidence of completion</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            You’ll need to provide the learner’s completion certificate from the training provider as evidence.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you’re submitting a 60/40 claim, evidence of completion is only required for the 40 part.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Saving or submitting</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you need to go away and find more information, click 'Save and finish later'. The claim will be saved to the 'Not yet submitted' list on the 'Manage claims' screen.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you've finished adding everything to the claim you can click 'Confirm details'. Read the declaration and tick the box to confirm you’ve understood it before you click ‘Submit claim’. This will send the claim for processing. The claim will move to the 'Submitted' status on the 'Manage claims' screen and you will no longer be able to edit it.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            The aim is to process your claim as quickly as possible, usually within 2 to 6 weeks.
