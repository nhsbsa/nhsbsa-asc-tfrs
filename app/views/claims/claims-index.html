          What we created

          <li>improved the start screen to make it make it clear this service isn't for booking training</li>
          <li>explored further ways to describe the funding pots
          <li>removed the service name so that users could vote on their preference without being swayed</li>
          <li>introduced a new claim screen to make it much easier for users to see what claim information they'd alredy added and what was incomplete or missing</li>
          <li>changed the concept of a 'claim' to relate to a set of learners doing a course on a particular date (rather than a claim only ever being for one learner) which massively shortens the claims list and relates better to users' mental models</li>
          <li>got the filters working on each tab of the 'manage claims' screen</li>
          <li>changed the 'insufficient evidence' status backed to 'queried' as this had caused confusion</li>
          <li>tidied up the data to make it more realistic and got the numbers of claims in each status working dynamically</li>
          <li>added column sorting and dummy pagination links to the 'manage claims' screen</li>

          <li>whether the new ways of describing the funding pots worked better for users</li>
          <li>if the improved way of starting and editing claims was more intuitive and allowed users to understand better the different components that make up a claim</li>
          <li>if the new definition of a claim works better than every learner on a course needing a separate claim</li>
          <li>how users would manage claims once they've been added and if they could progress a claim to the point at which it's paid</li>
          <li>whether the 'ready to submit' claim status is useful or if it could lead to confusion</li>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the descriptions of the 2 funding pots were better received (though 'direct care' isn't specific enough as it also relates to nurses and AHPs)</li>
          <li>many users incorrectly expected the service to allow them to book the training rather than just claim reimbursement</li>
          <li>users are much happier thinking about 'claims' rather than 'claim items'</li>
          <li>the combined 'start a new claim' flow generally worked well, though many users felt there were some unecessary steps (for instance, having to view course and learner details when adding them)</li>
          <li>users were often unclear what the learner ID referred to and whether it related to their internal systems</li>
          <li>the confirmation emails were seen as helpful</li>
          <li>the process of adding evidence was confusing as users were unsure what they needed to upload and when</li>
          <li>in general, as users went through the flow to start a claim they seemed unsure about how far through the process they were, what happens next and whether their progress had been saved</li>
